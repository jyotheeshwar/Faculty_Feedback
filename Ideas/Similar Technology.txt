RATE MY PROF
--------------------

The Baap of all websites.

New version of the web app is a SPA

Find prof, school and rate prof.
Profs can be found by name or by school list. 
Association between prof and school.
Overall rating on different criteria shown. 
Individual rating for multiple courses by the same prof also goes. 

We can implement searching for a course rating based on course code alone, since the courses are pretty much the same irrespective of who is teaching it in India. 

Profs can claim the account as well so that they can monitor it. 
If we are rating a prof, all the associated profs in the dept where the prof works in is also shown simulatenously. 

Pretty neat layout.

Finding school based on name and location also present. 

The entire app is based on JSP. Questionnaire type ratings. 
Social media plugins too now being supported. 

Login/SignUp is provided, but we should ensure an authenticated mechanism like FB ID. Ensure that ratings are anonymous to prevent backlash.

MYEDU
-----

Seems interesting and certain features can be implemented, like profile store and job search - think on this feasibility. 

KOOFERS
-------

combines rating and job search/profile posting. They take GPA data as well, which I'm not sure how feasible it would be, especially with them using DoB as a key factor to see your results on evarsity.

RATE MY TEACHERS
----------------

VERY similar to Yelp and Zomato. Same rating graphics as Zomato :|
