###Ideas - Iteration:1 

#####Ratings:
1. Rate based on Questionnaire: A bunch of questions with yes or no. Questions like "Is the teacher biased, do they prefer bookish answers, etc." can be answered well with this model.
2. Rate based on Marking Scale: 1-5 or Poor to Excellent. Point 1 & 3 can't be covered in this model unfortunately.
3. Text area: Not sure. They might rant a lot of things which might be very inappropriate. Has to be moderated if we go ahead with this model.

#####Analytics:
1. Provide graphical stats based on above ratings system. If we go with the first rating model, the stats must show "76% of the students feel this teacher is a biased person" or "37% people rated 5/5, 42% people rated 4/5". 
2. Provide stats for where the teacher stands with respect to his department in college, region, and country. This can bring about a competition from different parts of the country thereby forcing universities to maintain quality. 
3. Provide stats for a university and its course based on the ratings obtained. If more than half the teachers get less than average ratings, then the department of that university is obviously not doing well.

#####University Details:
1. Talk about the curriculum may be. 
2. Talk about infrastructure and lab facilities. 
3. Talk about support provided to carry out projects. 
4. This is because, if they are extorting lakhs, just shooing students away with some grades is not the right thing. With the competition increasing everyday, opportunities must be provided for them to shine better. We could implement this in future. 
5. Give complete program statistics if possible.

#####Fame:
1. Already we are defaming quite a few people, so no need to add a Hall of Shame
2. Add a Hall of Fame, give recognition for being the best rated teacher of the university, or country, or department, or region. Our website could have separate hall of fame for such people. 
As much as we can defame teachers, we must motivate them to do something which can help them shine as well.

#####Teacher Information:
1. No profile pictures. They can lead to misuse. Rate My Professor does not have it too. 
2. Their previous work experiences in other universities, if applicable. 
3. Proper tracking to make sure when a professor joins other college, details are updated.

#####Student Access:
1. A student must be able to rate only teachers belonging to his university. 
2. Probably make them sign up using college email ID. But many colleges in India do not provide such facility. We need brainstorming on this. 
3. Or no rating more than once from same IP Address.
4. If a teacher has done something in Anna University, students from SRM must not go defame or fame them because some friend requested them to. That's nonsensical. 
We need to figure out a way to make sure students rate a teacher only once, and only those teachers belonging to their university. 
5. Check Teacher Information last point. Going by that logic, if a teacher who was in SRM is now in CEG, and I am a final year student in SRM, I must be able to rate him/her. Because he belonged to my university
